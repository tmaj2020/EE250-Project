Project Description---------------------
This project is dedicated to the EE250 final project assignment.

To reflect the concept of node to node communication, we're going to refer back to
one of our previous projects in the use of the grove.py sensors lab where we used a
rangefinder to detect when an object was in a specific range from the sensor. We'll
have this version of our rpi setup communicate with our laptops via some kind of
notification system (likely through email).

The sensor itself will be collecting data so long as it is powered (data collection)
and will even be able to discern when someone has entered a room before sending out
an email in accordance with its intended function.
